# J2M
## JIRA to MarkDown text format converter
Convert from JIRA text formatting to GitHub Flavored MarkDown and back again. Just because I got tired of reformatting text between GitHub (PR's) and JIRA.

## Website
Use J2M online at: [http://j2m.fokkezb.nl/](http://j2m.fokkezb.nl/) (updated automagically)

## Roadmap
I hope to extend TiCons with the following features:

* Add as much syntax support as time allows me and need drives me :)

Feel free to [mail](mail@fokkezb.nl) me or fork the code and send a pull-request.
